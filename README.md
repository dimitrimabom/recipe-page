## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

I've concentrated here on explaining how SCSS works. 

To initiate the SCSS packet, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

And so that the SCSS package continuously observes the **style.scss** file and converts it into CSS in the **style.css** file at the root of the project, use this command :

```bash
sass --watch style.scss style.css
```

### Useful resources

- [SCSS Docs](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - Install Sass and learn out to use.
